1) Write a java function that adds all the digits of an integer until it is single digit. (You may assume that input is a positive number)
		i. function takes an integer as input and returns its sum of digits.
		ii. for example input = 37, sum = 3+7 = 10, sum = 1+0 = 1. result = 1.

		Here is the prototype you can work with
	
		public int addDigits (int input){
			//Write your code here
        	}

2) Write a method to find the maximum and minimum number in an array of numbers
	Example:
		Input : [3, 5, 7, 1, 4, 32, 15]
		Output : Max is 32 and Min is 1

        public void findMaxAndMin(int[] array){
		//Write your code here
        }

3) Write a method that takes a String and character as input and find how many characters are in the String
	Example #1
		Input : "North", 'r'
		Output : 1      //Explanation: "North" has 1 'r'

        public int characterCountInString(String s,char c){
		//Write your code here
        }
